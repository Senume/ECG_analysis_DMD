# ECG_analysis_DMD

## **INTRODUCTION**

Welcome to the research paper implementation repository for ["Analysis of ECG Signals by Dynamic Mode Decomposition"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9626454). This repository contains the code and resources used in the implementation of this research project.

The goal of this project is to diagonis Heart-related diseases using ML models and investigate its overall performance. The approach utilized in the paper evaluate whether the stability of decomposed ECG subsystems can be analyzed in order to effectively investigate the overall performance of ECG signals^[].

The repository is organized as follows:
1. src
    1. Beat_Frame_FeatureExtraction_Base
    2. ML Training
    3. Pan_Tompkins_Class
    4. Signal_Analysis_Class
2. Feature_Extraction
    1. Beats
    2. Frames
