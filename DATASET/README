The databases contain either 549 conventional 12-lead resting ECGs or the corresponding measured Frank lead ECGs. 
The ECGs are digitized at a sampling rate of 1000Hz (0.5 µV/LSB; 16 Bit ADC). 
On special request this database may be available at sampling rates up to 10,000Hz.

Up to five follow-up ECGs are available from subjects of the following diagnostic classes:

Myocardial infarction 		148 pts. 
Cardiomyopathy/Heart failure 	  18 pts. 
Bundle branch block 			  15 pts. 
Dysrhythmia 				  14 pts. 
Myocardial hypertrophy 		    7 pts. 
Valvular heart disease 		    6 pts. 
Myocarditis 				    4 pts. 
Miscellaneous 			    5 pts. 
Healthy controls 			   54 individuals.

Every patient is supplied with an information string containing age, gender, diagnosis, and where applicable, data on the medical history, medications and interventions, coronary artery pathology, ventriculography, echocardiography, and hemodynamics.
